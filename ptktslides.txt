Title: Core Automation Framework - Knowledge Transfer

Presenter: [Your Name]

Date: [Date]



---

Slide 1: Introduction

Purpose: A reusable core automation framework to accelerate test development

Language & Tools: Python, pytest, pytest-bdd

Packaging: Distributed as a .whl file



---

Slide 2: Folder Structure

src/
 ├── main/
 │   └── pages/       # Core page classes
 └── test/
     └── tests/        # User test files

Uses namespace package layout (no __init__.py)

All components reside under src/



---

Slide 3: Installation & Setup

Install via: pip install core_framework.whl

Includes:

setup.py with entry points

MANIFEST.in to include non-code files




---

Slide 4: Core Components

conftest.py in src/main for reusable fixtures

Common fixture: driver with autouse=True

Example:


@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def driver():
    # setup
    yield driver_instance
    # teardown


---

Slide 5: Hooks and Fixtures

pytest hooks:

pytest_runtest_makereport

pytest_sessionstart, etc.


pytest-bdd hooks:

pytest_bdd_before_scenario


Custom ordering:

@pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True)

@pytest.hookimpl(hookwrapper=True)




---

Slide 6: Extending the Framework

Users create their own tests and conftest.py

Reference core fixtures by importing

Extend/override as needed



---

Slide 7: Execution & Reporting

Use pytest CLI to run

Reporting handled via hooks

Output can include:

Screenshots

Logs

Custom HTML reports




---

Slide 8: Best Practices

Keep tests isolated

Avoid hardcoding data

Use autouse cautiously

Group reusable steps



---

Slide 9: Common Issues

Missing __init__.py causing import errors (if not namespace)

Hook not executed due to missing decorator

Fixture scope mismatch



---

Slide 10: Future Enhancements

CI/CD Integration with GitLab

API testing using signed requests

Multi-browser support



---

Slide 11: Q&A

Open discussion




Great! I've created a KT slide outline for your core framework. You can now edit or export it as needed. Would you like help turning it into a PowerPoint presentation or expanding on any slide?
