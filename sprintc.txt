Sprint Retrospective – Suggested Comments
1️⃣ On KT & Requirements
KT sessions are happening very close to sprint start/end, which limits time for understanding application flows before automation begins. Earlier KT and basic walkthroughs would help improve sprint predictability.
2️⃣ On Test Case Quality
Several test cases require clarification or refinement during automation due to unclear or high-level steps. More detailed and reviewed test cases would reduce rework and delays.
3️⃣ On New Applications
Since applications are new to the team, initial sprints involve significant learning and framework adaptation. Factoring a learning curve into planning would improve estimation accuracy.
4️⃣ On Velocity / Spillover
We are seeing test cases spilling over across sprints due to dependency on KT, environment readiness, and clarifications. Revisiting sprint scope or reducing parallel application onboarding may help.
5️⃣ On CI/CD Effort
CI/CD setup and stabilization efforts are currently overlapping with automation delivery. Estimating CI/CD work as separate tasks may help balance sprint commitments.
6️⃣ On Sprint Planning
Sprint commitments are currently made before full clarity on application behavior and test case readiness. Planning after KT and grooming could improve delivery confidence.
7️⃣ On Focus & Context Switching
Working on multiple new applications in parallel increases context switching and impacts productivity. Focusing on fewer applications per sprint may improve throughput.
8️⃣ On Overall Process (Strong but Safe)
Current timelines appear aggressive given new applications, unclear test steps, and CI/CD expectations. A re-baselining of scope versus capacity could help achieve sustainable delivery.
🔹 If they ask “What can we improve next sprint?”
Use one of these:
Advance KT sessions and test case grooming before sprint planning.
OR
Limit the number of new applications onboarded per sprint.
OR
Separate CI/CD stabilization work from automation story commitments.

Mid-sprint scope additions (e.g., new test cases added after work already started) impacted focus and delivery. Clear prioritization and scope freeze during the sprint would help.
